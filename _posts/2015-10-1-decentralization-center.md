Hello world,
hello again.

It's not the first time I renew, restart, reload my blog {% sidenote 1 'See [old.virginialonso.com](http://old.virginialonso.com)' %}, and it probably won't be the last.

After a while without posting, I'm coming back with new ideas, new inspirations, and new goals. I will be drawing, I will be thinking aloud, and I will be learning.

A lot has happened in the past year: I finished my studies, I started my new role, I've been drawing more and I'll soon be starting a new language. For once, I'd like to capture all these big changes somewhere and my mind feels transient so this new blog seems like the right companion.

Hasta pronto!
